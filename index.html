                    <p>I am Shruti Gaonkar. I live in Los Angeles, California.
                        I am originally from Goa, a small state in India
                        known mainly for its beaches, architectural monuments, and churches.</p>

                    <p>As a college graduate in Computer Engineering, I was confused 
                        as to what would be the best career option in this field given that it is so vast. 
                        Dropping my resume in and around the city, I met my first employer through an acquaintance. 
                        He had a start-up and was looking for freshers. That is where I landed my first job in 
                        web development. I was mainly involved in the backend development but also got to work on 
                        frontend over a while.</p>
                
                    <p>Currently, I am a homemaker and want to expand my knowledge in web development.
                        In this field, technologies are changing rapidly and we have to keep pace with it.
                        The Bootcamp in full-stack web development allows me to expand my web developer skills
                        and learn the latest technologies.</p>

                    <p>In my free time, I like to read books and surf the internet. I like 
                            spending time with my family and do my bit for the environment by recycling and
                            also gardening being my best eco-friendly hobby.</p>
